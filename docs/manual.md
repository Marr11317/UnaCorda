This file explains the structure of the `src` directory.

# Manual

## Fonts
The original fonts (Bravura and Petaluma) are contained in the `fonts` subdirectory.
Along with the originals are the `sfd` files, which simply are the originals saved with FontForge.

## Feature files
Features.fea is the entry point of the `.fea` files.

The other files are self explanatory.

For documentation on the `.fea` format, see the [OpenTypeâ„¢ Feature File Specification](http://adobe-type-tools.github.io/afdko/OpenTypeFeatureFileSpecification.html)
